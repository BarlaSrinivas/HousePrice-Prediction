## 🏠 Features

The California Dream Home Price Predictor allows users to input the following features:

1. Median Income (in tens of thousands)
2. House Age (years)
3. Average Rooms
4. Average Bedrooms
5. Population
6. Average Occupancy
7. Latitude
8. Longitude

Based on these inputs, the model predicts the estimated price of the home.
